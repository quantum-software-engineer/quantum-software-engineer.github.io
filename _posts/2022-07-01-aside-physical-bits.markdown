For software engineer, both bits and qubits are purely abstract mathematical constructions. However real computers are not concepts, they exist in the physical world and are made of something. The good news is that, the algorithms we write do not depend on the physical substrate.

For example, a classical bit is any object that has two states of existence and can be flipped from one state to the other. In the history of computing this has been implemented using switches, light signals and vacuum tubes. Modern computers use transistors to implement bits, whose state can be read and changed by reading and applying electrical currents to the transistor. Using transistors and electricity allows extremely fast read and write operations on bits, which coupled with the ability to miniaturize large transistors circuits on chips has made silicob based computing as the dominant physical implementation paradigm.

Qubits do not yet have such a dominant paradigm. Today differnt companie sand universties are trying diffferen methods, but none so far have achieved the far and away advantage like silicon wafer did for classical computers. Qubits are implemented in superconductords, lasers, trapped ions, even diamonds.
