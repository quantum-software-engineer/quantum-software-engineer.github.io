Note that in the previous chapter, we did not define the operations on qubit data structure. So, what operations can you do with a qubit?

Think of what you would do with classical computers. You have a number of bits. To do any computations, you need to apply transformations on bits, also known as gates. You may be aware of gates such as OR, AND, NOT, NAND etc. There is a well known result that NAND gates are universal, i.e. you can make any gate or combination of gates using just NAND gates as building blocks.

So let's look at the NAND gate -

Truth table - ``

Lets make these concepts quantum. There is a single universal gate in the quantum world as well called the Toffoli gate. But unlike classical computers, quantum hardware is not advanced enough to the point that we can easily build hundreds of Toffoli gates to simulate other gates. Therefore we try to minimize the numbers of gates we have to build even if it means building different types of gates. So let us learn about some of the quantum gates, dont worry, there are only 4 you need to know right now.

## The Pauli gates - X Y and Z

## CX

That was easy enough. Now we just need to know one more thing before we can do some quantum computation. And this is where it gets real.
